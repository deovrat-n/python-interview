f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")     f = open("demofile.txt")

print(f.read())

f = open("D:\\myfiles\welcome.txt")

with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())

f = open("demofile.txt")
print(f.readline())
f.close()

with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  print(f.read(5))

By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  for x in f:
    print(x)
