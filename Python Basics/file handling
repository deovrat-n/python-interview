By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line:
with open("demofile.txt") as f:
  for x in f:
    print(x)

with open("demofile.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("Woops! I have deleted the content!")

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exists
"rb" → Read binary

"wb" → Write binary


import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")

if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
